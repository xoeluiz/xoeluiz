🔭 What I do ?
Make that thing of yours even better. I can help either with the big picture or with specifics.

😏 ABOUT ME?
Sure! I'm jlt, a passionate junior front-end web developer based in Germany. I've completed a one-year apprenticeship as an IT Specialist for Web Development, where I honed my skills in HTML/CSS, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript, SASS, and Vue.js at NetMarket PMS GmbH.

At Georg-Simon-Ohm-Berufskolleg in Cologne, I expanded my knowledge by learning Python and other fundamental theories. My education didn't stop there; I've devoted over 5,000 hours to self-study over 14 months, earning more than 80 international certifications from platforms like LinkedIn Learning, freeCodeCamp, and Codecademy.

From December 2022 to July 2023, I worked as a front-end and TYPO3 developer at Einmahl WebSolution GmbH in Cologne, Germany. Now, I'm eagerly seeking a new IT opportunity worldwide to further my career and contribute to exciting projects.
